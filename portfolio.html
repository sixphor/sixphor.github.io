                                <p>Using Unity, I created my escape room game "Your Heart, Your Reality". In this game, the player must solve puzzles in order to escape the rooms and complete the game.
                                     The game was created using the Unity engine, creating elements and objects and placing them in the scene to form an environment.
                                      In this project, C# was used to create the game's features such as opening the doors, picking up objects, clicking buttons.

                                <p>Using a combination of Node.js, PHP and MySQL, I created a storybook app, "No Book, No Life".
                                     This application allows people to create a user with a name, profile picture and description. 
                                     It also allows the main part, creating books, with a title, author, book cover, and synopsis.
                                      The book list and user list will be updated accordingly when one is created or deleted.
                                     Throughout the creation of the app, I discovered how to implement multiple features and how to link to a local database, where all the book and user information are stored.

                                <p>This project is a full-stack workout tracking web application, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 
                                    The app allows users to create personalized workout routines, track progress, and log their exercises with details such as sets, reps, and weight.

                                    On the frontend, I implemented React for building a responsive and dynamic user interface, 
                                    providing users with smooth navigation and interactive features like workout timers and exercise history tracking. 
                                    The design focuses on simplicity and functionality, allowing users to easily create, edit, and view their workout plans.

                                    <br>
                                    On the backend, I used Node.js and Express to handle user authentication, session management, and data storage. 
                                    MongoDB was utilized as the database to store user profiles, workout logs, and performance metrics. 
                                    The backend supports secure operations, with JWT-based authentication to protect user data.

                                    Built using React Native, the app delivers a smooth and responsive user experience, with intuitive navigation and functionality tailored for book enthusiasts.

                                    The app provides a clear summary, showcasing the current deficit or surplus, allowing users to track their financial health at a glance. 
                                    Developed using React Native, the app offers a user-friendly interface with smooth navigation. 
                                    Above is a demonstration video of its features.

                                <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I created some avatar designs.
                                     These designs were created from scratch and they are variants of the same avatar, with different hair, clothes, expressions and more.
                                     I used a variety of tools to create this design and learnt a lot of use techniques along the way.
                                     Each body part was made on its own before then combining them to form a human character.</p>

                                    I designed the app with a focus on user experience, ensuring smooth navigation and a visually appealing layout. 
                                    The color scheme combines soft neutrals with vibrant highlights to create a balanced and engaging aesthetic.
